    "text" : "I’m a full stack web developer based in Seattle working as a freelance web developer for the past year. I’ve been primarily working with JavaScript and React to build response and dynamic front ends. Using node with express to build the backend. The more I learn of React the more that I love working with it. I’m eager to start learning other stacks and technologies to further expand my skill set. I work well solo or in a team environment with a preference on team. Getting to bounce ideas off other developers to build a better product or to help when stuck I’ve always found to be a better way to complete the task at hand. I’m interested in a career in Web Development or Software Development.",
