# Portfolio

This is the start of my own person website that I will use on job applications to showcase what I can do as a full stack webdeveloper. The main site will mostly cover what I can do as a front end developer but I'm current in the works of making some applications that will showcase what I can do full stack. I'd like this site to be one page that when you want to view other parts of the site will dynamically change the current page to show the information that the user is wanting to see.
