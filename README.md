# Portfolio

First rendition of my protfolio using jQuery and Bootstrap to create the site. Decided to go with a one page design for ease of viewing and the better showcase the information that I want the viewer to see. Next rendition of the site I plan on exploring different CSS frameworks and to use React. Building in a blog section for the site to talk about my experience with the University of Washington coding Boot-camp. Having a seperate page to showcase all the work that I did in the boot-camp. Changing my portfolio page to display personal projects that I have made and potentially work projects.
